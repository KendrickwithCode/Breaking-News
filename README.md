# Breaking-News
A Python program that scrapes headlines from various sources using Regex to interpret common html tags. Some sources may not work as those common phrases change over time, you can use wayback machine or change the Regex in the source code but 9News and ABCNews generally work.
You can also check the website source or export selection which stores the headline in a simple database file.
